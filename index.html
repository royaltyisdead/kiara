          Freddie and Bri bring valuable and unique strengths to Hyve Managed
          Hosting. Freddie drives sales through his technical knowledge and
          relationship-building skills, though he occasionally struggles with
          time management and multi-tasking with all of his clients. Bri
          provides crucial legal protection and strategic insight, but her
          perfectionist tendancies and communication style may sometimes create
          longer work time of tasks. Both are integral to the Hyve's success,
          with Freddie excelling in client engagement and sales performance, and
          Bri ensuring legal customer compliance and legal alignment.
